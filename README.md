# Console-Finance-M4

Description
This was a javascript challenge to analyse data from a finance company to find the profit and losses for that company over a few years.

Issues
This was a tough challenge. I spent most of time reseaching the web to try and find the content I needed.
I watched some tutorials and read some articles.
I struggled with 2D arrays.
